inp = """[Brett0_Ghett0]: how do i know you are not just a non admin who wants my progress in fractran
[mib_8fty4x]: the ctrl-f approach to randomGenProb2 is doubtful
[TheDoctor]: grep
[mib_8fty4x]: >regex
[Brett0_Ghett0]: is your friend ;P
[mib_8fty4x]: aint got time for that
[Brett0_Ghett0]: who do i talk to about fractran
[JacobEdelman]: Keith is not real
[mib_8fty4x]: besides how could you find english words in succession with regex?
[JacobEdelman]: Keith please don't impersonate Admins
[JacobEdelman]: or I will take that name and give it to somebody more worthy
[Brett0_Ghett0]: banhammer
[JacobEdelman]: LittleBobbyTables: has been pretty awesome
[Brett0_Ghett0]: banhammer
[Keith]: i didnt
[Keith]: i just said he COULD talk to me
[JacobEdelman]: hmm, it uses inverse which isn't in a lot of regex testers
[JacobEdelman]: including the official definition
[Brett0_Ghett0]:   aaaaaaaand he just left
[LittleBobbyTables]: JacobEdelman: /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/ doesn't check for composite numbers?
[JacobEdelman]: ummm, ask ben
[JacobEdelman]: and composite checking exists
[JacobEdelman]: just not prime checking
[LittleBobbyTables]: It does, yes, but that checks for primes ^_^
[JacobEdelman]: negation isn't technicaly allowed in regex
[aaronberger]: I'm back!
[LittleBobbyTables]: Everything is technically allowed in everything if it works.
[TheDoctor]: hi
[mib_ygu3g2]: hi
[TheDoctor]: swiched chat clients
[JacobEdelman]: yeah
[Ezra]: You can use IRC without breaking somthing, congratz
[LittleBobbyTables]: GJ Jacob
[JacobEdelman]: aaronberger: you are now super opped
[JacobEdelman]: be thankful
[Keith]: [tag:op-pls]?
[Keith]: oh, not SE
[LittleBobbyTables]: brb restarting router.
[Keith]: :
[Keith]: Where's the othr keith?
[aaronberger]: hem
[JacobEdelman]: what other keith?
[aaronberger]: doesn't feel any different
[aaronberger]: on my end
[JacobEdelman]: i know
[JacobEdelman]: super op can do like nothing extra
[JacobEdelman]: just technical stuff
[JacobEdelman]: I think
[aaronberger]: still says op tho
[JacobEdelman]: ...you are super op
[Keith]: y?
[aaronberger]: I'll try refreshing
[aaronberger]: ah.  Now it works
[Keith]: sdmin ftw
[Keith]: Admin ftw
[Keith]: i can't type :P
[LittleBobbyTables]: JacobEdelman: can you make mode +q? It makes joins parts and nick changes not show up, only messages
[LittleBobbyTables]: It would clean up the chat a little bit
[Keith]: hi derpy
[derpy]: hello
[Keith]: root@ircbox:~$ clear
[LittleBobbyTables]: Good job Keith, you can clear things
[JacobEdelman]: berger, you happy?
[Keith]: can i?
[JacobEdelman]: it says you are an admin
[JacobEdelman]: berger
[LittleBobbyTables]: Well you cleared whatever you were working on
[mib_fsijxx]: Anyone know where I can find a decent list of colors in a .txt format
[mib_fsijxx]: or something I can easily move over to .txt
[JacobEdelman]: a bit to specific
[JacobEdelman]: of a question
[JacobEdelman]: google it
[LittleBobbyTables]: "large list of colors" oughta do you some good
[TheDoctor]: I can't decide...
[JacobEdelman]: what others user levels are there?
[JacobEdelman]: we have 4 different ones
[JacobEdelman]: but I want more!
[TheDoctor]: whaaat
[whaat]: hiya
[JacobEdelman]: different irc op levels
[mib_fsijxx]: How can I copy only a collum of data from wikipedia without taking the other stuff
[VeniVidiVici]: whoa look there's people here
[mib_fsijxx]: like one colum straight down
[LittleBobbyTables]: Can you add +q for channel mode? It takes out join, parts, and nick changes
[TheDoctor]: columncopy - chrome extension
[JacobEdelman]: can you prove that, cause website says it gives someone else owner status
[LittleBobbyTables]: channel mode?
[LittleBobbyTables]: hold on
[VeniVidiVici]: lol
[LittleBobbyTables]: yeah
[LittleBobbyTables]: Channel Mode +q is quiet
[LittleBobbyTables]: user +q is give owner :p
[JacobEdelman]: link?
[LittleBobbyTables]: https://www.alien.net.au/irc/chanmodes.html
[VeniVidiVici]: can i be the first (actually probably not the first but w/e) to say wwp is all trolls
[LittleBobbyTables]: wwp?
[VeniVidiVici]: also did you guys win in quizbowl
[VeniVidiVici]: i heard you guys played bca
[JacobEdelman]: your not the first
[JacobEdelman]: (and wwp is us)
[JacobEdelman]: we placed in bca, it was fun
[VeniVidiVici]: gjgj
[mib_fsijxx]: TheDoctor: How the hell do I use column copy
[JacobEdelman]: i'm not gonna do +q cause with all the username trolling it will make this irc more confusing
[JacobEdelman]: I recommend you just copy the text and write a program to proccess it into whatever format you want
[TheDoctor]: install chrome extension; right-click in column>columncopy>copy this column
[JacobEdelman]: NO CHROME!
[LittleBobbyTables]: Dolphin master race!
[JacobEdelman]: wait, what?
[LittleBobbyTables]: What what?
[Jo_Schmo]: 12hz master race!
[LittleBobbyTables]: Sometimes I swear my friends are somewhat illiterate.
[aaronberger]: still here
[tissin]: I heard about an illiterate haystack once.
[tissin]: he forgot how to use spaces
[LittleBobbyTables]: He's not a haystack though
[mib_fsijxx]: TheDoctor: is the file saved somewhere or to my keyboard
[LittleBobbyTables]: Well, did you write it on your keyboard?
[LittleBobbyTables]: If you didn't, I don't think it's on there.
[JacobEdelman]: why would you write on your keyboard? I mean, its a nice keyboard, you don't want to get ink all over it
[whaat]: GUYS I USED TO GO TO WWP
[JacobEdelman]: really?
[LittleBobbyTables]: What if I use a sticky note?
[VeniVidiVici]: lol i love the name littlebobbytables

[mib_fsijxx]: Can somone please copy the plual animals column
[aaronberger]: it WOULD be nice wouldn't it :)
[mib_fsijxx]: of this webpage http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/animals/Animalbabies.shtml
[ben_edelman]: Yeah...not allowed....
[aaronberger]: please don't post helpful links withough confirming with us first
[aaronberger]: however for clarification
[aaronberger]: we're not asking for "herd" or "colony"
[mib_fsijxx]: I am using column copy
[mib_fsijxx]: and it doesnt do crap
[aaronberger]: we want "antelopes
[aaronberger]: or "bats" 
[aaronberger]: etc.
[VeniVidiVici]: wait for which problem
[aaronberger]: the funky yellow ducks one
[VeniVidiVici]: oh ok
[aaronberger]: for plural you would use "ducks", not "flock"
[VeniVidiVici]: are answers case sensitive
[VeniVidiVici]: (yes, i'm just now asking this)
[TheDoctor]: Sigh
[aaronberger]: some of them are
[aaronberger]: the answers that are explicitly provided are usually case-sensitive
[mib_jfac4s]: where should one start for yangwy?
[aaronberger]: the ones that you need to find, decrypt, etc.  usually aren't
[aaronberger]: for recon, google is always a good place to start
[TheDoctor]: Some mute ^^^
[TheDoctor]: *someone

[HoucksSexyCADTimeFun]: hi
[Brett0_Ghett0]: FREEHOUCK
[Brett0_Ghett0]: ^(background info)
[Brett0_Ghett0]: houck: shop/cad teacher ot busted for smoking pot
[HoucksSexyCADTimeFun]: basically he is the cad teacher who got busted for weed
[TheDoctor]: asdf
[HoucksSexyCADTimeFun]: selling, not smoking
[aaronberger]: theDoctor, please don't post animal name lists or anything else that might be helpful in chat
[Brett0_Ghett0]: they THINK he was dealing to students, but they aren't sure
[TheDoctor]: aaugh!!
[HoucksSexyCADTimeFun]: but he didnt do it himself
[tjbecker_]: Frank, please shut up.
[TheDoctor]: those animals didn't help
[mib_jfac4s]: anything specific to look for in recon? like addresses, jobs, etc
[Brett0_Ghett0]: you'll know a flag when you see one
[VeniVidiVici]: what brett said
[Brett0_Ghett0]: also look at the example places to hide, then get creative
[aaronberger]: yeah.  If you're guessing at a recon flag, then you haven't found it yet.  Once you find it you'll know you found it.
[franklesby]: we still need forensics
[Brett0_Ghett0]: TJ's ctf had one that was "edward snowden's" reddit account
[TheDoctor]: Has anyone gotten a recon thingy???
[franklesby]: that was fun
[mib_u9fi9f]: Hey what admins are here
[franklesby]: everyone with a star
[mib_u9fi9f]: That are active
[JacobEdelman]: i am here
[franklesby]: everyone but awe
[JacobEdelman]: pretty much
[mib_jfac4s]: recon is too hard lol
[franklesby]: gtg, cyall l8r
[aaronberger]: bye!
[aaronberger]: also I am an admin, you an message me
[aaronberger]: *you can
[VeniVidiVici]: we've gotten a recon one
[VeniVidiVici]: they're not impossible
[whaat]: awe is hard af
[mib_fp0b58]: I think it's a lot of luck though
[VeniVidiVici]: not really
[TheDoctor]: :/
[TheDoctor]: :(
[mib_fp0b58]: the two I got were mostly luck
[whaat]: ive been on awe forever
[VeniVidiVici]: you need to be clever with your searching
[VeniVidiVici]: and you need to know what's useful and what's not
[mib_fp0b58]: I'm not sure it's even possible to be methodical about the name recons once a few obvious things fail
[VeniVidiVici]: but obviously i can't get more specific or we'll get banned lol
[Ezra]: gfd
[mib_jfac4s]: I still can't get recon, just don't know what to look for. Nothing seems to be popping out
[nitroC3H8O3]: good 'ol recon
[thedoctor]: :/
[nitroC3H8O3]: in my <strike>stalking</strike> recon, I actually found someone I know really well who knows Ernest
[VeniVidiVici]: which one are you doing
[nitroC3H8O3]: and I was going to ask them to ask him before I figured it out
[whaat]: I found Aaron's keybase and personal website but nothing is standing out :'(
[VeniVidiVici]: wow
[VeniVidiVici]: interestingly
[VeniVidiVici]: our team name is error 404 (i didn't choose it lol)
[VeniVidiVici]: and apparently there's another team called error 404
[mib_jfac4s]: lol
[VeniVidiVici]: and we're adjacent in standings
[VeniVidiVici]: so that's slightly confusing
[VeniVidiVici]: lol
[nitroC3H8O3]: :P
[ben_edelman]: One of them has a capital E.
[VeniVidiVici]: fortunately the teammate who chose our name
[VeniVidiVici]: apparently left caps lock on
[VeniVidiVici]: so that works
[_alex]: is there a backstory on why everything is named keith?
[mib_jfac4s]: going solo
[nitroC3H8O3]: \nick keith
[Keith]: Cuz keith created it
[JacobEdelman]: no backstory
[ben_edelman]: ....
[JacobEdelman]: at all
[Keith]: it's / not \
[nitroC3H8O3]: yup
[VeniVidiVici]: is there a frontstory
[nitroC3H8O3]: don't use irc much b/c my school blocks 6667
[Keith]: so does mine
[Keith]: but it doesn't block Tor
[nitroC3H8O3]: lol
[nitroC3H8O3]: same here
[LittleBobbyTables]: My school blocks every outgoing port except 80
[nitroC3H8O3]: wow
[Brett0_Ghett0]: #let's DdoS it
[LittleBobbyTables]: I've tried.
[LittleBobbyTables]: I've gotten in trouble for that
[Brett0_Ghett0]: what you actually need to do is perform an inside udp flood
[Keith]: i once started ~1400 ping processes to take down a router :P
[Keith]: it crashed my computer
[Brett0_Ghett0]: just write a udp script, or use some metasploit
[Brett0_Ghett0]: need a beowulf cluster 
[LittleBobbyTables]: Yeah last time I did that was from a school computer.
[Brett0_Ghett0]: you need to do it on multiples
[LittleBobbyTables]: I got in trouble for logging into the router as well.
[LittleBobbyTables]: NOT doing anything at all
[LittleBobbyTables]: But literally just logging in
[LittleBobbyTables]: It wasn't a router even, it was a switch
[Brett0_Ghett0]: ha
[Brett0_Ghett0]: lol
[Brett0_Ghett0]: one of my scout leaders actually said they got a guy fired for putting their own wif router in the roof
[Brett0_Ghett0]: when him and his friends were highschoolers
[LittleBobbyTables]: My schools like
[LittleBobbyTables]: "Yo it's cool you're doing this shit, don't do it to us"
[LittleBobbyTables]: so now i do it to my work
[LittleBobbyTables]: Cause I get paid for that
[Brett0_Ghett0]: lol
[Brett0_Ghett0]: IT
[Brett0_Ghett0]: is swag
[aaronberger]: hmm
[Brett0_Ghett0]: what you really need to do is take one of those 80 or so dollar 4 core intel ripoff of rpi and make a portable router flooder
[aaronberger]: I've gotten in trouble for various things involving school computers...
[LittleBobbyTables]: or just take the one from your work
[Brett0_Ghett0]: a computer or the 4 core rpi
[LittleBobbyTables]: The only reason I haven't gotten expelled is because I go to a STEM school, so they're cool with it
[Brett0_Ghett0]: yeah
[Brett0_Ghett0]: my school would kik us out
[Brett0_Ghett0]: kick
[LittleBobbyTables]: the only time people have gotten suspended or expelled
[LittleBobbyTables]: is because of fights
[mib_kp34x7]: We had someone suspended last year for hacking
[Brett0_Ghett0]: we've had like 3 repeat offenders only get some iss
[mib_kp34x7]: and this year rumor has it 2
[Brett0_Ghett0]: i'm so mad, kali doesn't have a driver for m wifi card :(
[Brett0_Ghett0]: time to goto ubuntu
[LittleBobbyTables]: how does it not?
[VeniVidiVici]: wait can i ask for a clarification on a problem
[LittleBobbyTables]: virtual box?
[nitroC3H8O3]: you can ask; whether you receive is the question
[nitroC3H8O3]: :P
[aaronberger]: yeah
[aaronberger]: message me, if I can clarify something I will
[nitroC3H8O3]: also, when is awe usually online?
[aaronberger]: good question
[aaronberger]: erm
[whaat]: has anyone gotten awe?
[aaronberger]: I think he plans to be online during school hours during the weekdays
[nitroC3H8O3]: ok
[nitroC3H8O3]: you guys are EST right?
[nitroC3H8O3]: nvm
[whaat]: i got be
[whaat]: but not awe
[whaat]: :'(
[nitroC3H8O3]: nice :)
[VeniVidiVici]: wait are you guys like
[VeniVidiVici]: supported by wwp
[VeniVidiVici]: not like supported
[VeniVidiVici]: but like condoned lol
[whaat]: affiliated you mean?
[VeniVidiVici]: well kind of
[VeniVidiVici]: like
[aaronberger]: well
[ben_edelman]: We are condoned.
[VeniVidiVici]: do they let you off school for it lol
[aaronberger]: we are all from wwp-north
[VeniVidiVici]: or is it more a free time thing
[aaronberger]: but this isn't officially supported by our school
[JacobEdelman]: free time thing
[VeniVidiVici]: oh ok
[aaronberger]: although we do plan to get the school to pay for shipping of the prizes :)
[VeniVidiVici]: god i'm bad at phrasing questions
[whaat]: guys has anyone gotten awe
[Brett0_Ghett0]: why is there a freaking rollover ad between important buttons
[JacobEdelman]: awe is at work I think
[mib_c4zxq0]: Probably. I think it has something to do with his keybase. I'm almost sure be is on keybase.
[JacobEdelman]: shhh
[whaat]: i've been on his keybase forever
[JacobEdelman]: no hints
[JacobEdelman]: mib_c4zxq0: 
[JacobEdelman]: like really
[mib_kp34x7]: huh
[mib_c4zxq0]: Sorry, I don't know the answer either :p
[mib_kp34x7]: oh 6
[mib_kp34x7]: *^
[JacobEdelman]: guys
[LittleBobbyTables]: Stop breaking irc
[JacobEdelman]: I'm gonna break it in a second
[JacobEdelman]: make sure you can't chat
[JacobEdelman]: can you guys chat
[JacobEdelman]: lol
[JacobEdelman]: so quite
[JacobEdelman]: and peaceful
[JacobEdelman]: okay
[nitroC3H8O3]: "quite"
[nitroC3H8O3]: bye guys
[mib_c4zxq0]: I need to know... Why is Ernest hiding so well...
[VeniVidiVici]: hm if i google aaron weiss
[VeniVidiVici]: the suggested is "aaron weiss autistic"
[ErnestChiu]: pff
[ErnestChiu]: what
[aaronberger]: yeah
[mib_c4zxq0]: o:
[LittleBobbyTables]: Make it +M again nd I can talk :P
[aaronberger]: I saw that too
[aaronberger]: loool
[JacobEdelman]: oh wow
[JacobEdelman]: it worked
[JacobEdelman]: I thought he had to be op
[LittleBobbyTables]: Yea
[JacobEdelman]: why can you talk>
[LittleBobbyTables]: Registered nicks
[JacobEdelman]: oh
[LittleBobbyTables]: Not op'd nicks
[JacobEdelman]: how do we stop all talking?
[LittleBobbyTables]: uhh
[LittleBobbyTables]: hold on
[LittleBobbyTables]: +m
[LittleBobbyTables]: Only op'd or voiced (+v)
[JacobEdelman]: umm ernest
[JacobEdelman]: undo it
[JacobEdelman]: please
[JacobEdelman]: ERNEST!
[JacobEdelman]: it won't let me
[LittleBobbyTables]: What'd you do
[JacobEdelman]: oh wait
[JacobEdelman]: it is -M already
[JacobEdelman]: [facepalm]
[JacobEdelman]: everybody can talk, right?
[LittleBobbyTables]: Right now, yes
[aaronberger]: is there a problem?
[JacobEdelman]: okay, good
[JacobEdelman]: nope
[JacobEdelman]: turns out their isn't 
[JacobEdelman]: for now
[JacobEdelman]: not only ops and voiced can talk
[JacobEdelman]: okay, good
[LittleBobbyTables]: 18:16 -!- #HSCTF You need voice (+v) (#HSCTF)
[aaronberger]: hello to you too
[LittleBobbyTables]: Now if you do the one before that (+n?) then I can talk as well :P
[JacobEdelman]: its +M
[LittleBobbyTables]: ok, so +m is voice and ops, +M is registered and ops
[LittleBobbyTables]: +n is channel members only
[JacobEdelman]: but yeah, we need it for tonight, when all the admins are sleeping
[JacobEdelman]: somewhere from 2 am to 6:30 am
[LittleBobbyTables]: which one?
[LittleBobbyTables]: +m, I would assume?
[JacobEdelman]: that time span
[JacobEdelman]: +m
[JacobEdelman]: yes
[VeniVidiVici]: admins sleeping
[VeniVidiVici]: what is this madness
[LittleBobbyTables]: Admins need to uberman
[JacobEdelman]: we don't need sleep, we just enjoy it
[JacobEdelman]: just like we don't need to take corporal form, but we do
[LittleBobbyTables]: corporeal?
[JacobEdelman]: did I spell that wrong?
[LittleBobbyTables]: Yeah
[JacobEdelman]: oops
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: you can't do uberman for a short period of time.
[LittleBobbyTables]: You totally can
[LittleBobbyTables]: I believe in you guys
[JacobEdelman]: hey awe, you wanna stay up all night?
[JacobEdelman]: or late anyway?
[LittleBobbyTables]: You'll be dead tired tomorrow and probably the day after
[LittleBobbyTables]: But you totally can
[JacobEdelman]: we have school
[JacobEdelman]: sadly
[Brett0_Ghett0]: school
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: nah, you'd be better off just not sleeping at all
[Brett0_Ghett0]: what a joke
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: the 20 minutes every six hours will kill you.
[RDX]: uberman?
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: uberman takes serious adjustment.
[RDX]: nvm
[Brett0_Ghett0]: it's true though, if your staying up, do it all night
[LittleBobbyTables]: 20 minutes every 4 hours, or 30 every 6
[Brett0_Ghett0]: OR have a study hall :D
[LittleBobbyTables]: 6 naps vs 4 naps. The first is easier, the second is easier to fit into schedules :P
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: erm, I disagree.
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: the former is easier to fit into schedules.
[JacobEdelman]: xkcd 28 hour schedule
[JacobEdelman]: :)
[LittleBobbyTables]: Every 4 hours is a lot harder to fit into schedules. Unless you plan it to right before an 8 hour job, lunch, then right after
[LittleBobbyTables]: but meh
[JacobEdelman]: wait what?!
[JacobEdelman]: xkcd is in 3d!
[LittleBobbyTables]: what/
[JacobEdelman]: oh, its just an old april fools thing I stumbled upon
[JacobEdelman]: 3d.xkcd.com
[JacobEdelman]: xkcd in 3d
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: it depends on what your schedule is.
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: as a university student, every four hours is easy.
[aaronberger]: oh hi
[LittleBobbyTables]: True.
[LittleBobbyTables]: For something like school and a job (more than 10 hours a day), every 6 hours is easier imo
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: I couldn't have a sleep schedule like that if I wanted to.
[Brett0_Ghett0]: i can barely run on less than 8, but i also run/workout consistently
[LittleBobbyTables]: A lot of people can't, you need a certain gene for that one.
[LittleBobbyTables]: I run on about 4 hours a night, but I also get 1-2 naps throughout the day, depending on the day
[aaronberger]: I love me some naps
[JacobEdelman]: wow.. I typically get about 8 but need 10 to really function
[LittleBobbyTables]: 90% of humans sleep in 90 minute cycles, which is why sometimes you can sleep for 30 minutes less and feel great
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: no, I mean schedule.
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: I run on barely any sleep.
[mib_c4zxq0]: oh lord, keith is illiterate ;_; 
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: I just couldn't take naps every four or six hours.
[LittleBobbyTables]: Doesn't fit the schedule at all?
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: I have contiguous blocks where I'm busy for 14-16 hours.
[LittleBobbyTables]: Ahh that makes sense
[awe]: Pretty much everyday too.
[awe]: My sleep schedule is basically just sleep three hours every night.
[LittleBobbyTables]: I'm going to have a lot of time soon to adjust and make a better schedule
[LittleBobbyTables]: Problem is, I really won't have anything to do with that extra time.
[cganas]: Is anyone available to talk about Hoboken Houses?
[tillson]: Ok, I hate Fractrans
[aaronberger]: You're welcome for Fractran
[LittleBobbyTables]: Don't we all
[VeniVidiVici]: fractran is actually really interesting imo
[LittleBobbyTables]: You can go ahead and punch aaron if you want
[aaronberger]: Also, I can talk about any problems, feel free to message me
[VeniVidiVici]: but i haven't done the harder ones yet
[tillson]: I need to figure out how they work
[awe]: punch aaronberger though, not me.
[tillson]: which I'm having a hard time getting my head around
[LittleBobbyTables]: Oh right, I forgot there's two aaron's.
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: program more.
[awe]: LittleBobbyTables: I'd do anything to have an extra few hours each day.
[aaronberger]: If you don't understand how it works, feel free to message me
[LittleBobbyTables]: I do and can, problem is I'm not that creative. It's why I enjoy these sort of competitions
[LittleBobbyTables]: I can do something if someone asks, but I can't really think of what to do myself
[RDX]: Number One Fan seems like the trolliest one so far :/
[LittleBobbyTables]: That one is awkward
[mib_kp34x7]: I'm the worst at coding in my group
[mib_kp34x7]: and I'm currently scoring more than them all combined
[LittleBobbyTables]: I've scored 100% of my teams points
[ErnestChiu]: Fun fact: For HSCTF, Aaron Berger almost wrote more problems than the rest of us combined.
[awe]: Almost.
[LittleBobbyTables]: Fun fact: Aaron Berger did not write 75% of the problems, unlike to the belief of Jacob Edelman 
[LittleBobbyTables]: I used to have a bot that did that, but then I deleted it because I never ran it anymore.
[mib_9254dy]: Why do two Methacton have the same score?
[mib_9254dy]: What are you going to do to people who share flags like that..
[awe]: We don't know that they are, or are not.
[awe]: But if it appears that they are, one team will be disqualified.
[mib_9254dy]: How about you check the interval that they submitted those problems..
[VeniVidiVici]: well when i saw that it was pretty sktechy lol
[VeniVidiVici]: but it's not impossible
[VeniVidiVici]: especially since same score != same problems
[awe]: ^
[awe]: Yeah.
[mib_9254dy]: well only they can see if they do have the same problems
[awe]: No, we can too.
[mib_9254dy]: That is who "they" was referring to. 
[awe]: Oh, okay.
[mib_9254dy]: I was talking to VeniVidiVici.
[awe]: I thought you meant those teams.
[awe]: But yeah, we'll look into it.
[_alex]: does the example input for keith numbers give the correct number of base 2 keith numbers?
[mib_9254dy]: Ok.
[VeniVidiVici]: i highly doubt it alex
[_alex]: also @<mib_9254dy>
[_alex]: I'm one of the methacton teams
[_alex]: I didn't even know we had another team really trying
[_alex]: we haven't talked at all
[LittleBobbyTables]: Completely irrelevant to any of the problems here, but does anyone know a decent tutorial for doing modulo during calculations instead of the end? Mostly for some large numbers mod whatever in some programming challenges
[VeniVidiVici]: just stick ret=ret%(1000000007) everywhere lol
[awe]: mib_9254dy: For the record, they've solved almost completely different problems.
[LittleBobbyTables]: awe: can you check easily if there's any problems that no team has solved?"""
